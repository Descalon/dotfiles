# Descalon's dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles.
You know the drill; these are all my configuration files.

At some point the idea is to automate the creation of symlinks with `./setup.ps1` in both root and child directories.

## Directories

* gitconfig:
    My `--global` git config file
* nvim:
    Neovim distribution (plugins, mappings) for both neovim and vscode
* psprofile:
    All I need for my powershell setup: profiles, modules, extensions, oh-my-posh-themes.
    It's all here
* terminal:
    Windows Terminal settings
* vscode:
    Visual Studio Code settings and keybindings
